How to design better company-branded gear that's less wasteful, more fun, and more personal?

Company-branded swag can be fun to make and fun to receive. Unfortunately, it's often boring and almost always wasteful (how often does that logo-tshirt make it into regular rotation?). This project explored a better way.

**The key design insight is that people already own things they like.** Instead of putting the company logo on *something nobody wants*, we can put it on *something they already own*.

I art-directed, organized employees to bring in a wardrobe staple (that they already knew they liked), and coordinated with an embroidery studio that added a ~~little LaCoste crocodile~~ our office dog, Lenny.

The official logo at Wistia is two swooshes, which isn't nearly as endearing. Lenny is *especially* endearing, and a frequent star of videos. The art is by a talented illustrator on the design team, Michelle Fine.

As Director of Design at Wistia I had the opportunity to illustrate and art-direct many company-branded tees, totes, and stickers. Years later, the pair of socks with the little dogs on them is the only one I still love to wear.
